# token-case: change the text to be one token.
#
# Example:
#
#     $ echo "Foo Goo Hoo" | token-case
#     foo_goo_hoo
#
#     $ echo "Can't Stop Won't Stop" | token-case
#     cant_stop_wont_stop
#
# The script does this:
#
#   * Delete any character that is not a word character or whitespace.
#
#   * Change each run of spaces and/or underscores to one underscore.
#
#   * Change case to lower case.
