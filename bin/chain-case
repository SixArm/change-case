# chain-case: change the case of each word to use chain format.
#
# Examples:
#
#     $ echo "FooGooHoo" | chain-case
#     foo-goo-hoo
#
#     $ echo "foo_goo_hoo" | chain-case
#     foo-goo-hoo
#
# The script does this:
#
#   * Insert a dash character between any lower case character
#     followed by an upper case character.
#
#   * Translate any underscore character to a dash character.
#
#   * Change case to lower case.
